Level 1-1 JSON File explanation:

The dimensions are formatted as shown below
[columnStart, columnEnd, rowStart, RowEnd]

The columns go from left to right
The rows go from top to bottom


The size of the dimensions depend on 
    the size of the canvas 
    the size of the sprites
    the size of the SCREENSIZE variable defined in drawBackground.js


Example:
Lets say you cut a 16x16 sprite out from the sprite sheet
    Lets also assume the canvas has a size of 800x400

800/16 = 50 so columnEnd would be 50
400/16 = 25 so rowEnd would be 25
SPRITE_RATIO would start at 1 by default


If you want to double the size of the sprite whithout stretching them
    set the sprite size to 32x32
    set SPRITE_RATIO to 2

800/32 = 25 so columnEnd would be 25
400/32 = 12.5 so rowEnd would be 12.5
